This project is part of the Hardware Lab (**CE-40102**) course, featuring a UEFI application designed to display weather information and forecasts for users. The "UEFI Weather APP" directory encompasses the core logic for UEFI interactions and handling HTTP requests, implemented in `C`. In parallel, the "Weather API" directory houses the implementation of a straightforward API that communicates the weather status of a given city to the client, implemented using `Python` (`Django`). Further details on each of these sections are provided below.

## UEFI Weather APP
Server implemeted using `Django`.

## Weather API
Pure `HTML`, `CSS`& `JS` is used for user interface.
