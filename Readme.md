# UEFI Weather APP

This project is part of the Hardware Lab (**CE-40102**) course, featuring a UEFI application designed to display weather information and forecasts for users. The primary focus lies in the ability to interact with a network interface card (**NIC**) within the UEFI environment and initiate a simple **HTTP** request using the tools provided by **EDK II**, the standard UEFI implementation. This project serves as an excellent learning opportunity for working with the fundamentals of the UEFI environment and stands as a valuable reference for those seeking to utilize network interfaces within this setting. The resulting application serves as a convenient tool for users to check the weather upon turning on their computers.


## Tools
Some of the tools and technologies that our project mostly relies on are listed below:
- **Qemu**
- **EDK2**
- **OVMF**
- **KVM**
- `C`
- `Python`


## Implementation Details

Detailed explanations of implementations can be found in this [section](Code/Readme.md).

There is also a comprehensive [report](Document/Readme.md) (in **PDF**) for this project that outlines the steps and challenges encountered.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

Before starting our work, we need to install several packages and tools to build and run our program successfully.

Install the following packages using apt:

```bash
  sudo apt install gcc build-essential uuid-dev iasl nasm python-is-python3
```

### Install Qemu

To run our program on a simulator, the first step is to install **Qemu**. This tool allows us to conduct experiments on UEFI without directly interacting with hardware, saving both time and resources. On an Ubuntu operating system, you can install **Qemu** using the official apt repository, although this may provide an older version depending on your Ubuntu release. Alternatively, you can manually build it from the source, granting access to a wide range of releases.


To install **Qemu** and **OVMF** (a port of Intelâ€™s tianocore firmware to the qemu virtual machine) using apt:

```bash
  sudo apt install qemu-system ovmf
```

Or by building it from source:

```bash
  wget https://download.qemu.org/qemu-8.2.0.tar.xz
  tar xvJf qemu-8.2.0.tar.xz
  cd qemu-8.2.0
  ./configure
  make
```

**Note:** Building **Qemu** from source code may require different versions of **gcc**, **nasm**, or **iasl**, depending on its release version. To ensure a successful build, it's important to install the correct versions of these requirements. You can refer to the [**Qemu** documentation](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/) for more detailed information.

### Prepare EDK II and OVMF

Your text comes here
```bash
  pyhton server.py -p 8080
```

| Parameter | Type     | Description                |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
| `-p` | `int` | **Required**. Server port |



## Results
Here, you can observe the results of running our UEFI Weather APP on **Qemu** (version: 4.2.1, 2019). The program is built using **EDK II** (tag version: edk2-stable201911). The following four pictures depict the successful execution of this program in the UEFI shell:

![Successful Execution 1](Miscellaneous/success-exec-1.png)
![Successful Execution 2](Miscellaneous/success-exec-2.png)
![Successful Execution 3](Miscellaneous/success-exec-3.png)
![Successful Execution 4](Miscellaneous/success-exec-4.png)

There are also situations where errors may arise, such as difficulties in finding the network interface or issues in communicating with the API. Our program is designed to handle most known possible errors effectively. The following two pictures illustrate these scenarios and demonstrate how we manage to address them. In the first case, we neglected to execute network configuration commands (as shown in [startup.nsh](Code/startup.nsh)) before running our program, which is necessary to prepare the UEFI shell to communicate with the **NIC**. On the other hand, in the second case, we failed to provide the correct access token for our weather API, resulting in access being denied.
